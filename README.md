# Data Science Templates

In this Repository I will be uploading templates for data science projects, from uploading and cleaning data to machine learning & deep learning models. In the repositories there are links to the main source of every code used. 

The templates have to be modified depending on the project and replaced the sample values. 

The templates also follows the order of  normal project in Data Science: Acquire the data -> Explore & preprocess the data -> Analyze the data with models -> Visualize the results

Index:
* #### [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/rubenyanes/DataScienceTemplates/blob/main/Data_Preprocessing_Template.ipynb)
  * Import libraries
  * Import data: csv, json, excel, html and sql query. Create dataframe 
  * Data visualization: basic information, data selection
  * Clean data: outliers, duplicates, strip spaces
  * Taking care of missing values: count nan/null values, delete, replace
  * Encoding categorical data: replace manually, label encoding, one hot encoder
  * Splitting the data set
  * Feature Scaling
* #### Machine Learning - Supervised Learning
  * [Regression](https://github.com/rubenyanes/Data_Science_Templates/blob/main/Regression_Template.ipynb): Simple & Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost
  * Classification
* #### Machine Learning - Unsupervised Learning (coming soon)
  * Clustering
  * Dimensionality Reduction
* #### Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning (coming soon)
* #### Natural Language - Processing (coming soon)
* #### Deep Learning (coming soon)
* #### Good practices
  * Model Selection (coming soon)
  * Pipelines (coming soon)
  * Functions & loops (coming soon)
